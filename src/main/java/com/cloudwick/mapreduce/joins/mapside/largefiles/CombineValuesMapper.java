/**
 * Once the values from the source files have been joined, the Mapper.map method is called, it will receive a Text
 * object for the key (the same key across joined records) and a TupleWritable that is composed of the values joined
 * from our input files for a given key. Remember we want our final output to have the join-key in the first position,
 * followed by all of joined values in one delimited String. To achieve this we have a custom mapper to put our data
 * in the correct format
 *
 * In the CombineValuesMapper we are appending the key and all the joined values into one delimited String. Here we
 * can finally see the reason why we threw the join-key away in the previous MapReduce jobs. Since the key is the first
 * position in the values for all the datasets to be joined, our mapper naturally eliminates the duplicate keys from
 * the joined datasets. All we need to do is insert the given key into a StringBuilder, then append the values contained
 * in the TupleWritable.
